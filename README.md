# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. The user can click 'Add Employees' and will be prompted to enter an employee's first name, last name, and salary. If the user clicks 'continue' they will be able to continue adding employee data. If the user clicks 'cancel' they are presented with a list of the employees in alphabetical order. When the user opens the developer console, they will be able to view a list of employees as originally entered, the average salary for all employees, and the name of a random employee.
